# Re: Alma 36. Chiasmus

### The Reverse Parallelism

According to the Book of Mormon Student Manual published by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:

> ## Alma 36-39
> *Chiasmus, sometimes called an inverted parallelism, is a Hebrew literary form where words or ideas are arranged in a certain order and then repeated in reverse order. This repetition emphasizes important ideas and words. In addition, the writerâ€™s main idea is often located at the center of the chiasmus.*
> 
> *Alma used chiasmus to tell the story of his conversion to his son Helaman. The presence of Semitic literary forms such as chiasmus in the Book of Mormon is an external witness that the book is what the Prophet Joseph Smith taught that it is: a translation of an ancient text written in a Middle Eastern language.*
> 
> *The following chart will help you recognize the chiasmus in Alma 36. For convenience, positions are designated in the chart from left to right, starting with the letter A and ending with the letter P. Thus, the thought expressed in the beginning verse of the chiasmus, Alma 36:1 (labeled position A), is repeated in the last verse of the chiasmus, Alma 36:30 (also in position A). The thought in Alma 36:2 (labeled position D) is repeated in verse 29 (also in position D), and so forth.*
